After their grand return just [last month](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-06-15-mca-ayim-2019) these two popular events are now here to catch up with the present! With newly revised categories, website quality-of-life updates, and badges now being given to the winner for every category, the scale of the events are only growing from here. Most events are by mappers, for mappers, but *everyone* is welcome to check out the festivities and leave comments on mappers they like from 2020!

## Mapper's Choice Awards 2020

Hopefully our recent edition has refreshed everyone on what MCA is. If not: it's a voting event with multiple categories, where mappers can nominate and then vote on what they think is the best in each given category, as well as what are the best maps of the year in the Grand Award. On top of that, we also have categories for voting on the generally best mappers, most promising newcomers, and more. The categories have been newly revised for our 2020 event as well.

If you ranked any beatmap or storyboard during 2020, you're now invited to help the mapping community decide those best of the best maps.

As in the 2019 edition, the Mapper's Choice Awards has three stages: nomination, voting, and results. Be sure to check our schedule above to know when each stage happens!

- **Nomination:** Eligible users can submit any beatmaps/storyboards or users from 2020 they feel are deserving of recognition in their respective categories.
- **Voting:** Eligible users can vote on the pool of submitted nominations.
- **Results:** Will be based off the results of voting and feature a livestream discussing each of the top winners. 

Those who win regular awards on their beatmaps or storyboards in the results will be given 2 months of supporter, and grand prize winners will receive 6 months of supporter. In addition, those who place first in any category will receive a unique **MCA 2020 badge** for their achievement. If you're not eligible to vote in MCA, your reward for following along will be getting to find out about super snazzy 2020 maps.

Nomination and voting will be happening through the [MCA website](https://mca.corsace.io). Remember, if you love something enough to nominate it, be sure to come back for the voting stage to vote it into the final leaderboards too.

## A Year in Mapping 2020

Viewing interesting statistics and leaving comments can be accessed on the [AYIM website](https://ayim.corsace.io/2019).

### Statistics

As it was in previous years, each mode will have a section of statistics such as who ranked the most sets, how many difficulties were ranked overall, the extremes in difficulty levels we saw ranked, and many, many more records than you can think of. Data is beautiful and this is peak cool trivia and data to see and learn. AYIM has all of those covered for the beatmaps and mappers ranked in 2020. Will Sotarks lead in over 70% of the osu! user category statistics again? Only one way to find out!

### Commenting on 2020 Mappers

Commenting on 2020 mappers? Anyone can do it, mapper or player or dedicated newspost reader alike.

Did someone rank your favorite map in 2020? Did they bless your heart with angelic kindness? Do you think they did something epic? Are they your cool friend? All this and more are valid reasons for leaving comments on mappers who ranked maps in 2020 on the *AYIM* portion of our website. The more awesome comments you submit, the grander it will be. You can directly contribute to it being _pretty awesome_.
